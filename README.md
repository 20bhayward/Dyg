2D Pixel Physics Sidescroller – Technical Overview and Recommendations
Every pixel in the game world will be an interactive simulated element, much like in Noita, where materials like sand, water, oil, and gas obey physical rules​
80.LV
​
EN.WIKIPEDIA.ORG
. Achieving this in a performant way requires careful choice of technology and architecture. Below we break down the key considerations and optimizations for building a Noita-like sandbox game, ensuring it runs smoothly on Linux and can be developed efficiently.
Programming Language Choice
C++ (Performance & Ecosystem): Noita’s own engine, the Falling Everything Engine, was written in C++ for close-to-metal performance​
NOITAGAME.COM
. C++ offers mature libraries (e.g. SDL2, Box2D) and decades of game development optimization. Its manual memory management and low-level control can maximize performance, though it puts the onus on the developer to avoid memory errors. Noita’s team even avoided exceptions in C++ to reduce overhead​
NOITAGAME.COM
. Given the need to update potentially millions of pixels in real-time, C++ is a proven choice that many similar projects (like The Powder Toy) have used successfully​
GITHUB.COM
.Rust (Safety & Concurrency): Rust is a modern alternative that guarantees memory safety and prevents data races at compile time. It delivers performance comparable to C++ in many cases, making it viable for a physics-heavy game. Rust’s ownership model can help manage complex multi-threaded physics without fear of undefined behavior. Developers have created falling-sand engines in Rust that leverage GPU compute shaders for speed​
GITHUB.COM
, demonstrating Rust’s capability. While Rust’s ecosystem for game dev is younger, it does have libraries for SDL2, and even a native physics engine (Rapier) if one opts not to use C++ libraries. If starting fresh today, one might consider Rust for its “fearless concurrency” benefits – especially helpful in a multi-threaded simulation – while still achieving “realtime” performance comparable to C++​
REDDIT.COM
. The trade-off is a steeper learning curve for low-level graphics/SDL integration and fewer existing code examples for this exact genre.Others (C# or Java): Managed languages like C# (with Unity or MonoGame) or Java could theoretically handle a pixel simulation if carefully optimized to avoid garbage collection pauses. As one expert noted, as long as you use pre-allocated arrays and object pools to avoid runtime allocations, even Java/C# could run a realtime particle physics simulation​
REDDIT.COM
​
REDDIT.COM
. However, these languages introduce overhead (garbage collectors, JIT compilation) and typically have slower performance for heavy per-pixel loops. They also might not easily allow integrating a custom low-level physics algorithm without native plugins. For maximum performance and control on Linux, a native compiled language (C++ or Rust) is preferable.Recommendation: Use C++ for the core engine to leverage its performance and existing libraries. This is the safest route given prior art (Noita, Terraria, Powder Toy). If the development team is proficient in Rust and desires memory safety guarantees, Rust is a strong alternative – especially since it can interface with C libraries if needed. In either case, avoid high-level garbage-collected languages for the core simulation loop. Both C++ and Rust compile to efficient binaries that run smoothly on Linux, and both have good support in Linux tooling.
Rendering Backend
Efficient pixel rendering is crucial, since the entire world is essentially a vast pixel grid. We need a rendering solution that can handle updating and drawing potentially hundreds of thousands of pixels each frame.SDL2 (Simple DirectMedia Layer): SDL2 is a popular choice for 2D games and is used in projects like The Powder Toy​
GITHUB.COM
. It provides easy cross-platform window creation, input handling, and 2D drawing routines. SDL’s software-based rendering (blitting to an SDL_Surface then copying to the screen) is straightforward but not hardware-accelerated by default​
GAMEDEV.NET
. Redrawing a large pixel grid with software alone would quickly become a bottleneck. However, SDL2 also offers an accelerated rendering mode via SDL_Renderer which can utilize OpenGL/DirectX under the hood, or one can use SDL2 to create an OpenGL context manually. In practice, pure software SDL blitting will likely be too slow for smooth 60+ FPS with a high-resolution world, as others have found (CPU usage skyrockets without GPU help​
GAMEDEV.NET
).OpenGL: Using OpenGL for rendering the pixels can massively improve performance by offloading drawing to the GPU​
GAMEDEV.NET
. A common approach is to maintain the world’s pixel data in a CPU array and each frame upload it as a texture to the GPU, then render a full-screen quad (or tiled quads if world is larger than screen) with that texture. OpenGL is well-supported on Linux and integrates with SDL2 easily (SDL can give you an OpenGL context). Developers report that moving from SDL software rendering to SDL with OpenGL acceleration is “night and day” in smoothness​
GAMEDEV.NET
. With OpenGL, you can also leverage shaders for special effects (lighting, color shifts) with minimal extra cost.Vulkan: Vulkan is a more modern graphics API offering more explicit control and potentially better multi-threaded rendering performance. It can give marginal gains in CPU efficiency by reducing driver overhead. However, the complexity of Vulkan is significant for a small project – one needs to manage pipelines, command buffers, synchronization, etc. For a 2D pixel game, Vulkan might be overkill unless you plan to heavily multi-thread the rendering or integrate compute shaders in a unified framework. If you do aim for GPU-based simulation (via compute shaders), a Vulkan-based engine (or using wgpu in Rust) could make sense​
GITHUB.COM
. Otherwise, OpenGL is simpler and plenty fast for this scope.Frameworks/Engines: Higher-level frameworks like SFML or Love2D, or game engines like Godot/Unity, were not designed for updating every pixel’s material each frame. They excel at sprite rendering, but a falling-sand simulation is a different paradigm (more like a simulation or cellular automaton). Using them would either hit similar performance challenges or require engine modifications. Given our need for custom physics, it’s better to work at the SDL/OpenGL level or use an existing pixel-engine.Recommendation: SDL2 with OpenGL is an optimal combo. SDL2 handles window management, input, and can provide an OpenGL context on Linux easily. OpenGL then efficiently renders the pixel buffer using GPU acceleration​
GAMEDEV.NET
. This setup gives a good balance of ease-of-development and performance. In practice, we’d use an OpenGL texture to represent the world’s pixels and update it each frame (e.g., with glTexSubImage2D or streaming buffer). Modern OpenGL (or OpenGL ES for portability) is sufficient. If aiming for cutting-edge methods, one could use OpenGL 4.3+ compute shaders or OpenCL to update the physics on the GPU​
GITHUB.COM
, but that can be an optional future optimization. Vulkan could be considered in the long term for its compute and multi-threading advantages, or if using Rust, the wgpu library can abstract Vulkan/Metal/DX12 and offer a safe API. Initially, sticking to OpenGL will get results faster.(On Linux, both SDL2 and OpenGL are well-supported. Ensure proper GPU drivers are present. SDL2 is available via package managers, and OpenGL comes with standard driver installations.)
Physics Engine (Granular Simulation)
The heart of this game is the granular physics simulation – essentially a falling sand simulation extended with various materials and interactions. Off-the-shelf physics engines (Box2D, Bullet, etc.) handle rigid bodies and sometimes fluids, but not at the pixel-level scale we need. Instead, we will implement a custom cellular automata-based physics system, complemented by a traditional physics engine for specific cases.Cellular Automata for Pixels: As described by Noita’s developers, their world is “based on a falling sand style simulation… essentially complex cellular automata”​
80.LV
. Each material type is assigned simple rules that determine how a pixel of that material behaves each frame, based on its neighbors. For example:
Sand/granular solids: if there is empty space below, fall down; else maybe slide diagonally down if possible. Sand piles up in pyramids because of these rules.
Liquids (water, oil, etc.): check if cell below is empty; if so, flow down. If below is filled, flow sideways (left/right) randomly​
80.LV
. Different liquids have different density – a lighter liquid will sit on top of a heavier one, accomplished by swapping positions if a lighter liquid is below a heavier liquid​
80.LV
.
Gases (steam, smoke): essentially the inverse of liquids – they rise until blocked​
80.LV
. If a gas hits a ceiling, it might spread sideways.
Fire: can propagate to adjacent flammable pixels. In Noita, fire checks neighboring pixels in random directions and ignites them if they are flammable (e.g., oil)​
80.LV
. If fire touches water, it might fizzle into steam instead​
80.LV
.
Solids (wood, stone): generally static. Wood burns away after some time when on fire​
80.LV
; stone is inert unless influenced by explosions.
These rules are relatively simple local interactions, but when applied to a large grid they yield emergent behavior where “you get surprising and unexpected results”​
80.LV
 – exactly the chaotic, creative sandbox we want.Implementing this means each frame (or over multiple frames in steps), we iterate over the world’s grid of pixels, updating their state based on neighbors. A naive approach would check every pixel every frame, but we can optimize (discussed later under multithreading and active regions).Rigid Body Physics: Not everything in the world should be simulated as free-falling pixels; it would be too costly and also unrealistic for large chunks. Noita smartly integrates a rigid body physics engine (Box2D) for certain cases​
EN.WIKIPEDIA.ORG
. For instance, a large chunk of concrete collapsing should behave as one piece, not disintegrate into individual pixels. In our engine, we will use Box2D (an open-source 2D physics library, proven and performant in C++) for:
Objects like props, crates, or enemies that the player can kick or throw.
Chunks of terrain that break off and fall as a whole.
The integration works by converting a group of pixels into a physical body when needed. In Noita, when pixels form a solid chunk that becomes dynamic (e.g. due to an explosion undermining a ceiling), they triangulate those pixels into polygons and feed them into Box2D as a body​
REDDIT.COM
. We can do something similar:
Detect when a contiguous region of “static” material (like rock) should break free (for example, if it’s no longer supported from below or explicitly triggered by an explosion).
Convert that region into one or more convex polygons (using a polygonization algorithm, e.g. marching squares to outline the shape, then triangulate).
Create a Box2D body (or compound fixture) for that shape and remove those pixels from the grid simulation (or mark them as part of a rigid body).
Simulate that body with Box2D (gravity, collisions) until it comes to rest. If it breaks apart or is destroyed, translate that back to pixels (e.g., shatter into debris pixels if needed).
Using Box2D allows robust handling of collisions and constraints for these larger pieces, instead of trying to model everything with cellular rules. Noita uses Box2D for things like falling minecarts, kicking barrels, etc., as noted on its wiki​
EN.WIKIPEDIA.ORG
. We will follow this hybrid approach: cellular automata for small-scale fluid/grain behaviors, and a physics engine for large rigid interactions.Interaction Between Systems: The pixel simulation and rigid bodies must coexist. Examples:
Rigid bodies moving through liquids should push the liquid pixels out of the way (Noita does this – e.g., a chunk falling into water will displace water). We might handle this by detecting overlap between a moving rigid body and fluid pixels, and converting some pixels to small particles or applying forces. Noita’s devs mention moving pixels into a particle simulation when disturbed by rigid bodies for a less “blobby” look​
BLOG.MACUYIKO.COM
.
Explosions can affect both systems: they can blow pixels out of the grid and also apply impulse to Box2D bodies. We’ll likely treat explosions as events that query both the grid (clearing or converting pixels in radius) and the physics world (applying forces to bodies).
Existing Physics Frameworks: Other than Box2D for rigid bodies, there’s no pre-made engine for the pixel simulation at this granularity – we will write it custom. Libraries like LiquidFun (an extension of Box2D for fluid particles) or Chipmunk can handle hundreds or thousands of particles, but not on the order of a full screen of fluid with distinct material types. The Powder Toy (open source falling sand game) essentially has its own engine in C++ for this. Our simulation will be bespoke, tailored to the materials we want to include and optimized for our use-case.
Procedural World Generation
We want an endless (or at least large), replayable world with diverse biomes, cave systems, and strategically placed events or points of interest. Procedural generation will create the world’s layout each run, while possibly following a fixed overall structure for game progression.Overall Structure (Biomes/Levels): In Noita, the world progression (mines → snow caves → etc.) is largely fixed in order, to maintain game pacing​
80.LV
. We can adopt a similar approach: define vertical “slices” or layers for biomes. For example, start in a Forest Mine biome, below that a Lava Cavern, deeper an Ancient Ruins biome, etc. This ensures the game isn’t completely random – the difficulty and content can ramp in a controlled way. Within each biome, the layout is randomized.Terrain Generation Techniques:
Noise Functions: Using Perlin or Simplex noise to carve terrain is a classic method. For instance, generate a 2D noise field and threshold it to determine solid vs empty space, which can produce natural-looking caverns. This can be combined with gradient bias (e.g., more open space near the top of a region, more solid near bottom) to mimic geology.
Cellular Automata Cave Generation: Another approach for caves is to use cellular automata algorithms (like “start with random fill, then iteratively smooth”). This can produce organic caverns and tunnels. Parameters (like neighbors threshold) can be tuned for bigger or smaller caves.
Wang Tiles / Prefabs: Notably, Noita uses Herringbone Wang Tiles to piece together pre-designed chunks of terrain​
80.LV
. They created a set of pre-made “rooms” or segments that can fit together seamlessly, placed in a herringbone pattern to avoid obvious repeating seams​
80.LV
. Within those, they still randomize contents (enemies, items with some probability). This approach yields very natural-looking levels with controlled randomness. We can take inspiration from this by designing, say, a dozen template cave sections for each biome, and then using a tiling algorithm to arrange them in a large grid that feels random but is built from known-good pieces. It’s more work upfront (designing pieces), but gives a lot of flexibility to ensure connectivity and include special structures.
Caves and Open Areas: The world being a side-scroller implies large open caverns and vertical shafts. We should ensure some vertical connectivity (e.g., tunnels going down) so the player can descend. Techniques like Midpoint Displacement or multiple frequency noise layers can create undulating cavern floors and ceilings. For large caves, sometimes simply subtracting one noise field from another can yield pockets and arches.Biomes Differentiation: Each biome can have its own set of materials (snow and ice in a cold biome, lava and basalt in a volcanic biome, etc.), its own monsters, and unique terrain algorithms. For example, an “ice caves” biome might use cellular automata to carve caverns in solid ice, whereas a “mines” biome might generate more linear tunnels and shafts (perhaps using something like Perlin worms or drunken walk algorithms to simulate mining tunnels).Resource Distribution: Resources (like ores, treasures, alchemy ingredients) can be placed during generation. A simple method is noise-based: e.g., use a noise function to scatter gold ore pixels within stone, or place pockets of liquid in cavities. Another method is iterative placement: for example, after carving the cave, randomly choose some solid regions to convert to ore based on some probability and cluster size. Ensure resources make sense in context (e.g., more gold in deeper levels, etc.).Predefined Event Locations: We might want specific landmarks (e.g., an altar, a boss room, or a puzzle structure) to appear. These can be handled by injection of prefabs: design a small region manually (like a structure) and then during generation, carve out a spot for it. One could reserve certain coordinates or noise pattern triggers to place these. For instance, decide that somewhere in biome 1, at a random x position halfway down, we will insert a “mini-temple” prefab. Because the world is chunk-based, we can make generation deterministic by seed – so even though the player may not know where it is, it’s reproducible.We can also integrate event spawn logic with generation: e.g., mark a location for a special enemy spawn (like a robot in a vault room) or a physics trap (some large boulder precariously placed).Infinite or Bounded World: Noita’s world technically allows going very deep (they had “infinite fall” bugs during development)​
80.LV
. We can allow a very large world but it’s wise to put some practical limits or looping. An “infinite” horizontal world (Terraria-like) is possible with chunk generation on the fly. Vertical infinity is also possible but the gameplay might not support it well unless we repeat biome patterns. For now, we assume a large but finite world with a bottom and edges, to keep things manageable.Storage and Streaming: The world will be divided into chunks (e.g., 128x128 or 256x256 pixels each) for both generation and simulation. We won’t generate the entire world at once (especially if it’s huge); instead generate chunks as needed when the player approaches. We can seed our random generator with the world seed and chunk coordinates so that each chunk’s content is consistent. This chunking also lets us unload far-away areas to save memory, which is important in a big world. On Linux, we can use file storage or just memory-mapped techniques for an infinite world, but since performance is key, keep as much as needed in memory and avoid slow disk access during gameplay (perhaps generate everything up-front if the world is not too enormous, or generate in a loading thread just ahead of the player’s movement).In summary, our procedural generation will combine noise-based algorithms for natural variation, cellular automata for cave-like shapes, and possibly Wang-tiled prefabs for interesting structures​
80.LV
. We maintain control over the broad structure (biome layering, special events) while letting randomness fill in the details. This ensures each run is unique yet preserves balanced gameplay.
Multithreading Strategy
Simulating every pixel is CPU-intensive, so multithreading is essential to achieve real-time performance. We need to leverage multiple cores for updating the physics and perhaps other systems. However, managing concurrent updates on a grid can be tricky – two threads must not try to move the same pixel simultaneously or we’ll get race conditions or inconsistent results​
BLOG.MACUYIKO.COM
.World Chunking for Parallelism: The primary strategy is to divide the world into regions (chunks) that can be updated in parallel. If the player’s viewport covers, say, 9 chunks at a time (3x3 around them), we can assign different chunks to different threads for the physics update. We must handle interactions at chunk boundaries carefully (a pixel at the edge might move to a neighboring chunk). One approach is to have a small overlap or halo region that is updated by one of the two chunk threads to avoid conflict, or simply ensure that when threads synchronize, we process boundary interactions.Checkerboard Update Pattern: A notable solution used by Noita’s engine is updating in a checkerboard pattern​
BLOG.MACUYIKO.COM
. This means treat the grid like a chessboard and update, for example, all “black” cells in one tick and “white” cells in the next tick (or similarly partition the update within a single frame). This ensures no two adjacent pixels are updated at the same time, avoiding direct conflicts even if two threads work in the same area​
BLOG.MACUYIKO.COM
. By alternating, we eventually update all cells, and neighbors get a chance to move next step. This pattern, combined with careful thread assignment, means we can multi-thread the update of a single large chunk safely. We will likely use this in conjunction with chunking: e.g., within each chunk, use the checkerboard scheme to avoid race conditions on neighbors, then multiple chunks can be processed by different threads (since chunks are largely independent except at edges).Data Structure Considerations: We will maintain the world state in a single large 2D array (or 2D array per chunk). Some simulations use double buffering (two arrays: one for reading current state, one for writing next state) to avoid interference. Noita’s engine specifically did not use two buffers (to save memory and complexity) and instead carefully managed concurrent writes​
BLOG.MACUYIKO.COM
. We can attempt the same: update in place, but ensure a pixel isn’t moved by two threads. This is done by splitting work regions and using the checkerboard approach. If that proves too complex, a simpler route is to double-buffer the simulation (each frame, compute a new grid from the old grid). Double-buffering makes the update logic simpler (no worries about overwriting something that you haven’t processed yet), and threads can freely work as long as they write to the new buffer. The cost is memory (essentially 2x the world data) and some copying overhead. We might avoid full copying by ping-ponging buffers (swap pointers each frame).Task-Based Threading: We can implement a thread pool that processes chunks or even sub-regions as tasks. For example, if we have 8 cores and 16 chunks loaded, the pool can schedule tasks for each chunk’s half-checkerboard update. Once those complete, do the other half. Modern game engines often use task-based systems to balance load across threads rather than fixed one-thread-per-chunk, since the active areas might be fewer than threads available. Using something like C++17 <thread> or <future> with careful synchronization is possible, or libraries like Intel TBB or Rust’s Rayon could distribute the workload.Dirty Region Optimization: Instead of always updating every pixel, we can track dirty regions – areas where changes are happening​
BLOG.MACUYIKO.COM
. Noita’s engine keeps a “dirty rectangle” per chunk to limit how much of that chunk needs to be simulated​
BLOG.MACUYIKO.COM
. For instance, if an area is at rest (no particles moving), we don’t need to iterate over it until something disturbs it. We will maintain flags or bounding boxes of active simulation areas. When an explosion occurs or the player digs, we mark those chunks/areas as dirty. Each frame, threads only iterate over dirty areas (maybe expand a bit around edges in case fluids flow outward). If fluids or sand settle, we can shrink the dirty region. This can drastically reduce computations when large parts of the world are static (which they often are).Synchronization: We will need a synchronization point after each simulation step (frame) to ensure all threads have completed updating their region before rendering or before the next step. A simple barrier or joining threads each frame might suffice. Advanced: double-buffering can allow one thread to start rendering the previous state while others compute the next state, but that’s likely unnecessary complexity; the simulation step will probably be the bottleneck, not rendering.Thread Safety: We must be mindful of not only pixel updates but also interactions with other systems:
If the physics engine (Box2D) is running on a separate thread (which it can, or it might be updated in the main loop), we need to sync data between the pixel sim and Box2D (for example, when a chunk converts to a rigid body). It might be simplest to update Box2D and the pixel sim sequentially in the same tick, rather than fully in parallel, due to the coupling.
Writing logs or debug info from multiple threads – we’ll keep that minimal or use thread-safe queues if needed.
In summary, the best strategy is to use multiple threads to update separate world regions in parallel, employing a checkerboard update pattern to avoid neighbor conflicts​
BLOG.MACUYIKO.COM
. Each thread/process will handle a chunk or set of chunks, focusing only on active (dirty) areas to save work​
BLOG.MACUYIKO.COM
. This approach, combined with careful scheduling, ensures the pixel simulation scales across cores. Given Linux’s strong threading support (pthreads, etc.), we can expect good performance scaling. The goal is to have the simulation work divided roughly evenly so all CPU cores are utilized each frame, keeping frame time low.
Modern Optimization Techniques
To further ensure performance and scalability, we will leverage several modern game development techniques:
Data-Oriented Design & Memory Layout: Storing the world as a contiguous array of simple structs (or even just material IDs in a byte array) will improve cache performance. We should arrange data so that each thread works on a contiguous chunk to benefit from CPU caching (spatial locality). Avoiding pointers for each pixel (no object-per-pixel, which would be huge overhead) is crucial. This essentially is a large 2D array of bytes/ints for material, plus maybe parallel arrays for other properties like temperature or pressure if needed. Using small data types (e.g., use uint8_t for material type if <256 types) keeps memory bandwidth low. This also plays well with SIMD instructions if we ever optimize inner loops.
Spatial Partitioning: We already have chunking which helps organize the world. We can also use spatial grids or trees for certain queries – for example, if looking for nearby explosions or checking support for a chunk, we might utilize an acceleration structure. However, given the grid nature, often direct index math is enough (e.g., explosion affecting radius R means iterate a square or circle area in the array).
Inactive/Active Segregation: Similar to dirty regions, maintain lists of “active” particles (like a list of all sand or water pixels currently moving). Some falling sand games optimize by only iterating over particles that are in motion. We could have an array or vector of coordinates that need updating, updated each frame. However, maintaining that list for a large destructible terrain can get complicated (what if a pixel becomes active due to neighbors?). It might be easier to track active chunks or regions. But if performance needs, this is an avenue: an event-driven update where e.g., when a pixel settles, we stop updating it until something adjacent moves again.
Event-Driven Updates: Many world changes happen from discrete events (explosions, spells, etc.) rather than continuous movement. We will use events to trigger physics changes rather than brute-force checking everything. For instance, explosions: when an explosion occurs, we don’t simply remove pixels immediately in the physics loop. Instead, handle the explosion in an event: clear or change those pixels (e.g., turn some stone into falling rubble) at that moment​
80.LV
. As mentioned earlier, Noita turns certain stable pixels into “sand” when an explosion hits them to make them collapse​
80.LV
. This event-driven approach means the simulation doesn’t have to figure out “something exploded here” during its normal tick – it’s directly informed, saving a lot of unnecessary checks. We should design the game logic so that major interactions (explosion, magic effect, etc.) directly update the world state and mark relevant areas dirty for the simulation to process subsequent fallout.
Selective Physics Mode: We can designate certain materials as static until disturbed. For example, solid ground might not be simulated as falling pixels at all (to save CPU) until something undermines it. We essentially treat bedrock or large terrain as immovable by default, which it is, unless an explosion or digging cuts it free. At that point, we change those pixels to a dynamic state (sand or a rigid body). This greatly reduces the number of pixels we simulate each frame – static terrain doesn’t need to be iterated. This is exactly what Noita does: most static materials have no falling behavior until converted​
80.LV
. We will incorporate that: earth/stone etc. are static cells (ignored by the CA simulation) until flagged otherwise. Fluids and loose materials like sand are always active by nature.
GPU Acceleration: In the future, we could consider moving the heavy pixel simulation to the GPU. Modern GPUs can handle parallel updates for thousands of threads. A technique is to use a compute shader where each thread corresponds to a cell or a small block of cells and updates them simultaneously. There has been research and even hobby projects using GPU for falling sand (e.g., a Rust project using OpenGL compute shaders​
GITHUB.COM
). If CPU becomes a bottleneck, we could implement the CA rules in a compute shader that reads the current state texture and writes to a next state texture, effectively doing the simulation on GPU memory. The challenge is syncing that with the CPU (for game logic, AI, etc., and for extraction of rigid bodies). A hybrid approach might be to use GPU for fluid dynamics or pressure simulation (some falling sand games simulate pressure/air flow on a coarse grid to influence particles​
GAMEDEV.NET
). However, given our design, we likely stick to CPU for main simulation initially, and possibly offload specific effects (like large scale fluid flow or cellular automata that lend themselves to GPU) if needed. Using the GPU for graphics (rendering) is already planned; using it for physics would be an optimization to explore once the basic system works.
Multithreading (Modern APIs): As mentioned, using a task-based approach or an ECS (Entity Component System) can help structure multithreading. In an ECS, the pixel simulation could be one system that operates on the “grid component”, and an ECS engine could parallelize systems by default. However, managing millions of pixel entities in an ECS would be impractical; instead, we’ll treat the whole grid as a single component or module. For other parts of the game (enemies, projectiles), an ECS could be beneficial and those systems can run in parallel to the pixel simulation if they don't conflict. For example, AI updates or background music, etc., can run on other threads.
Profiling and Iteration: We will continuously profile the game (using tools like gprof or Linux perf or even custom counters) to find bottlenecks. Perhaps the pixel update in liquids is too slow – we might optimize that with lookup tables, or perhaps memory bandwidth is an issue – we might compress data or update in tiles to improve cache hits. Modern CPUs also vectorize operations; we can potentially use SIMD (with intrinsics or letting the compiler auto-vectorize) for operations like checking neighbor cells. For instance, processing 4 pixels at once in a vector where possible.
Linux-specific optimizations: Ensure use of multiple threads aligns with Linux scheduler (setting thread affinity isn’t usually needed, but we can experiment). Use epoll or similar for any I/O (though a sandbox game has little I/O during gameplay aside from user input). We might take advantage of Linux performance counters to tune (cache misses, branch misses). Also, making sure to distribute workload so one thread (like the main thread) isn’t overloaded while others idle – a task system helps here.
By combining these techniques, we aim to create a simulation that prioritizes work only where needed (active, on-screen areas)​
REDDIT.COM
, uses all available hardware parallelism, and avoids unnecessary overhead. The result should be a stable 60 FPS+ even with complex pixel interactions, on a typical modern Linux PC.With the research and plan established, we can now outline concrete steps for implementation and provide guidance for setting up the development environment and project structure.

Project Name: PixelPhys2D (A 2D Sidescrolling Pixel Physics Sandbox Game)Overview:
PixelPhys2D is a 2D side-scrolling sandbox game where every pixel of the world is simulated. Inspired by Noita, the game features falling sand-style granular physics, fluids, gases, and fire, all interacting in a procedurally generated world. Terrain is fully destructible – you can burn wood, dissolve rock in acid, or blow up structures and watch the debris fall. The world is generated anew each run with diverse biomes (e.g. mines, ice caves, lava caverns) and dynamic events, ensuring a unique experience every time. The engine is optimized for performance with multi-threading and hardware acceleration so that the simulation runs smoothly even with tens of thousands of interacting pixels.Key Features:
Every pixel is an element (such as stone, sand, water, oil, lava, gas, etc.) that follows physical rules (e.g., sand falls, water flows, gases rise, fire spreads)​

We use CMake to generate the build files. In the project root:
bash
Copy
Edit
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
This will configure the project in Release mode (optimized for performance). You can also do -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug for a debug build (with debug symbols, easier to step through, but slower). After configuration, compile the project:
bash
Copy
Edit
cmake --build . -j$(nproc)
The -j$(nproc) flag tells the build system to use all available CPU cores to compile in parallel, speeding up build time.If the build succeeds, you will have an executable (e.g., PixelPhys2D) in the build directory (or in build/bin/PixelPhys2D depending on the CMake setup).Troubleshooting Build:
If CMake cannot find SDL2, ensure libsdl2-dev is installed and CMake’s module path includes the SDL2 module. We provide a FindSDL2.cmake if needed. You can also set SDL2_DIR environment variable to the SDL2 cmake config path.
If using a different Linux distro, package names may vary. Install SDL2, OpenGL dev, and standard build tools accordingly.
Box2D: If not using the included source, make sure to install it and let CMake know where (-DBox2D_DIR= if using CMake config, or link the library manually).
Rust option: If a Rust implementation is present (in a rust/ subfolder), see a separate README in that folder for cargo build instructions. (By default, the C++ version is primary.)
Execution
After building, you can run the game:
bash
Copy
Edit
./PixelPhys2D
This launches the sandbox game in a window. By default, it will start in a pixel-art window (e.g., 800x600 or 1280x720) showing your character in a procedurally generated world.Command-line Options: (if implemented)
--seed <number> – Start a world with a specific seed (for reproducibility).
--width <pixels> --height <pixels> – Set the window resolution. The game by default scales the view; using a larger resolution increases the world area simulated at once.
--headless – (If applicable) Run the simulation without rendering (for testing performance or server-side runs).
Controls:
A/D or Left/Right arrows to move, W/Space to jump/levitate.
Mouse aim, left-click to use wand (if player has a wand/spell), right-click for secondary action.
E or F to interact (e.g., kick objects).
Number keys to switch spells (if implemented).
Escape to pause/exit.
Gameplay Instructions:
You control a character in a fully destructible environment. Explore the caves, and use spells or the environment to your advantage. For example, you can dig through soft ground by shooting or drop a burning torch to set oil on fire. Be careful with physics – collapsing a structure might crush your character or unleash liquids. There is no “win” condition implemented yet beyond exploration and experimentation (in future, we may add an end-game or goals). The fun is in the sandbox – experiment with different elements!
Performance Notes
The game is optimized to run at 60 FPS on modern CPUs. It automatically uses multiple threads for physics – you should see all your CPU cores being utilized when lots of physics is happening. The more active fluids and falling debris on screen, the heavier the CPU load. On a 4-core CPU, the simulation can comfortably handle on the order of ~100k active pixels at 60 FPS (equivalent to a screen full of water flowing). Large explosions might momentarily dip the frame rate if they activate a huge number of pixels – we continue to optimize these cases. The rendering is done via OpenGL, so having a GPU from the last decade (any OpenGL 3.3 capable card) should be fine. If you run on a very old machine or one without hardware acceleration, the game might fall back to software rendering which will be significantly slower​
GAMEDEV.NET
.If you encounter performance issues:
Try lowering the resolution or window size (fewer pixels to simulate).
Limit the number of active fluids at once (for instance, spawning enormous amounts of water will tax the system).
Ensure you compiled in Release mode – debug builds run much slower due to assertion checks and no optimization.
Technical Details (for those interested)
(This section is optional reading, included for completeness.)The engine uses a hybrid of cellular automata and rigid-body physics. Most static terrain is not simulated until it’s disturbed (for performance). Liquids and sand are simulated with local rules each frame. The world is divided into chunks, and we update the physics in parallel across multiple threads using a checkerboard pattern to avoid conflicts​
BLOG.MACUYIKO.COM
. We use SDL2 for windowing and input, and render the pixel grid through an OpenGL texture for efficiency. Collision and physics for large objects (like when you kick a minecart or when a chunk of roof falls) are handled by Box2D – we dynamically create physics bodies when needed and integrate them with the pixel world​
REDDIT.COM
.The procedural generation combines cellular automata cave generation with pre-designed segments arranged via Wang Tiles​
80.LV
, giving both randomness and crafted structure. Each biome has a distinct set of materials and monsters.The project is open source, so feel free to explore the code. We welcome contributions or optimizations from the community.
Known Issues
Some visual artifacts when large fluid bodies settle (e.g., occasional single pixel droplets hanging mid-air due to update ordering issues). These will be refined in future updates.
The simulation off-screen is paused for performance, so sometimes you might see things “start moving” only when you approach. For instance, a pool of liquid might only begin to flow once it comes into the active update radius of the player. This is by design to save CPU​

Saving/loading the world state is not implemented yet in this version.
Rarely, the chunk border physics can cause slight inconsistencies (we mitigate this with overlap regions).

Project Development Plan – PixelPhys2D
This document outlines the structured development tasks and implementation steps for the PixelPhys2D engine. It is intended for guidance in coding the project, ensuring all components are built in a logical order and with best practices. Each step should be verified on a Linux environment.
1. Project Setup and Initialization
1.1 Initialize Repository: Set up a new Git repository for the project. Create a basic directory structure (e.g., src/ for source code, include/ for headers, assets/ for any game assets, etc.).
1.2 Build System: Create a CMakeLists.txt for the project. Configure it to find SDL2 and OpenGL. Add compilation flags for C++17, enable optimization (-O2 or -O3) and multi-threading support (-pthread). If using submodules (e.g., Box2D), add them to the build. Ensure the project builds a simple executable (e.g., main.cpp) that currently just opens a window.
1.3 Dependencies: Include or install needed libraries. For now, plan to use SDL2 and Box2D. If Box2D is included as source, add it to the build; if linking dynamically, ensure the library is found. Verify on Linux by installing SDL2 (libsdl2-dev) and building a dummy program.
2. Core Framework
2.1 Basic SDL Window: Implement main.cpp to initialize SDL2, create a window (e.g., 1280x720), and an OpenGL context. Clear the screen with a color and present it. Handle an event loop that processes SDL events (keyboard, quit event, etc.). This will confirm our environment is correctly set up.
2.2 Rendering Surface: Set up an OpenGL texture that will represent the pixel framebuffer. For now, allocate a texture of a fixed size (maybe 256x256 for initial testing). Write a function to update this texture from a pixel array. Also render a full-screen quad with this texture. Use SDL to get an OpenGL context and load OpenGL functions if needed (GLAD/GLEW initialization).
2.3 Basic Game Loop: Structure the main loop to update and render at a fixed timestep. For now, just fill the pixel array with something simple (like a color gradient or some moving pixels) to ensure the rendering pipeline works. Cap the frame rate (or tie to VSync initially).
2.4 Input Handling: Add basic input processing (e.g., close window on ESC or on SDL_QUIT, perhaps print key presses). This sets the stage for controlling a player later.
3. World Data Structures
3.1 Define World Grid: Create a data structure for the world grid. Likely a 2D array (width x height) of cells. Each cell can be a struct or an ID representing material type. Define an enum or constants for material types (e.g., Empty=0, Stone, Sand, Water, Oil, Wood, Lava, Acid, Smoke, Steam, etc.). Initially include a few types like Empty, Sand, Water, Stone to test.
3.2 Chunking: Decide on chunk size (e.g., 128x128). Implement a World class that contains a grid of chunks. Each chunk can have its own 2D array of cells. Provide methods to get/set a cell given world coordinates (which find the correct chunk and index within it). This abstracts the world as one continuous grid.
3.3 World Initialization: Write a function to initialize the world grid. For now, maybe fill the bottom half with “stone” and top half with “air/empty” to simulate ground and sky. This will later be replaced by procedural generation, but we need a testable environment.
3.4 Synchronization Structures: If planning to use multi-threading, set up any needed structures such as mutexes or atomic flags for chunk updates. At this stage, we can plan a simple array bool active[chunkCount] to mark if a chunk needs updating. (Detailed threading will be implemented later, but design the world container to accommodate parallel updates – e.g., storing chunk data contiguously in memory.)
4. Procedural Generation
4.1 Noise Integration: Include a noise generation utility (you can use an existing Perlin noise implementation or write a Simplex noise function). Verify it works by generating a value for each cell and, for example, filling that cell with stone if noise > threshold.
4.2 Generate Terrain: Implement a basic terrain generator that uses noise and cellular automata for caves:
For each chunk, generate a 2D noise array. Combine it with some rules to determine solid vs empty. For example, if noise(x,y) > 0.5 mark cell stone, else empty, then run 2 iterations of cellular automata smoothing (any cell with <4 solid neighbors becomes empty, etc.).
Ensure chunks align at borders (you might use the same noise function continuously across chunk boundaries by offsetting coordinates with world position).
Introduce variation by biome: define biome regions (e.g., by depth y). For now, perhaps just one biome to test.
4.3 Place Materials: Extend generation to place different materials: maybe pockets of “sand” in ceilings, or pools of “water”. For testing, you could carve an “open area” and then randomly fill some part with water.
4.4 Special Features: (Optional initial step) Mark spawn point for player (e.g., top of world). Ensure there is open space there. This can be as simple as carving out a little empty area at the start.
4.5 Verify Generation: After generation, draw the world to the screen by coloring each material type differently. This will use our rendering texture. E.g., stone = gray, water = blue, etc. Run the program – you should see a procedurally generated cave structure. Tune parameters as needed.
5. Physics Simulation – Single Threaded Prototype
5.1 Update Function: Implement a function updateWorld() that iterates over the world grid and updates cells according to physics rules. Start simple: e.g., for each cell that is “sand”, try to move it down if empty below. For “water”, try down or sideways. Use the basic rules gleaned from falling sand games​
80.LV
.
5.2 In-place vs Double Buffer: For initial simplicity, implement using a secondary grid (double buffer). Create a new grid, copy the old, then for each cell apply rules and write results into the new grid. This avoids issues of updating and reading neighbors simultaneously. We can refine later. After updating all cells, swap the new grid as the current world.
5.3 Boundary Conditions: Ensure edges of the world (or chunk edges) are handled (e.g., cells at world boundary just don’t move out of bounds). Later, if world is infinite with streaming chunks, we’ll handle generating new chunks as needed.
5.4 Test Falling Sand: Populate part of the world with sand (perhaps drop a column of sand in mid-air in the initialization). Run the update loop and see if the sand falls and piles up. Adjust the logic for correct behavior (ensure sand “slides” off edges properly, etc.).
5.5 Add Liquids: Implement water logic similarly (flow sideways). Possibly add a simple liquid like water and test it – place a blob of water in a cave and see if it settles evenly. Ensure that heavier liquids stay below lighter (this can be done later by density check).
5.6 Performance Check: Even single-threaded, test the update speed on a reasonably sized world (maybe 256x256) at 60 FPS. Optimize inner loops if needed (e.g., avoid unnecessary checks). At this stage, logic clarity is priority; heavy optimization will come with multi-threading and refining active areas.
6. Multithreading Implementation
6.1 Thread Pool Setup: Implement a simple thread pool or use std::threads. For example, create N worker threads (N = hardware_concurrency or some fraction) that wait on a condition variable for tasks.
6.2 Divide World into Tasks: Determine how to split the world update for parallel execution. A straightforward way: one task per chunk (or per few chunks). Implement a function to update a single chunk’s cells (with awareness of needing neighbor info at boundaries).
6.3 Checkerboard Approach: To avoid race conditions when updating in parallel, implement the checkerboard update scheme​
BLOG.MACUYIKO.COM
:
In each chunk update, first update all cells with, say, even sum of indices (i+j even) and move them. Then update cells with odd indices. This way within one chunk you don’t have two adjacent being processed in the same sub-step.
Additionally, ensure that two adjacent chunks are not updated at the exact same time on conflicting steps. One approach is to color chunks in a checkerboard as well (like chunk (x,y) even vs odd) and update all “even” chunks in one phase and “odd” in another. This may be enough to prevent cross-chunk interference.
6.4 Synchronization: Use barriers or join threads after each phase. For example, all threads finish updating even-index cells, sync, then proceed to odd-index cells. Or update even-chunks, sync, then odd-chunks.
6.5 Activate/Deactivate Chunks: Integrate the dirty/active concept. Only dispatch tasks for chunks that have any active pixels. Maintain flags or a list of active chunks that gets updated when something changes (e.g., if a pixel moved out of a chunk or an explosion occurs). Initially, you might simply mark all chunks within the player’s viewport as active each frame.
6.6 Testing: Conduct tests with multithreading on. Drop a large amount of sand or water and ensure it behaves the same as the single-thread version (aside from potential ordering differences that shouldn’t be noticeable). Debug any concurrency issues (if some pixels appear to “teleport” or jitter, it might mean two threads wrote to it – adjust locking or update order).
6.7 Performance Measurement: Use timers to confirm the multithreaded update is scaling. For example, print the time taken for update with 1 thread vs multiple. Ensure no significant overhead from thread management each frame. If using a thread pool, threads should persist and only tasks are assigned each frame to avoid constant creation/destruction.
7. Rigid Body Physics Integration (Box2D)
7.1 Integrate Box2D: Initialize a Box2D world (gravity pointing downward). Set up basic Box2D simulation step (usually 60 Hz). This can run in the main loop after pixel simulation.
7.2 Define Conversion Logic: Decide when to create a rigid body from pixels. A simple heuristic: if a cluster of, say, >= N connected solid pixels (stone/wood) has all its below support removed or is triggered by explosion, convert it.
7.3 Detect Floating Chunks: Implement a function to scan for unsupported terrain chunks. One approach:
After the cellular automata update, find any “floating” clusters of terrain pixels that are not connected to the ground or large mass. (This can be done via a flood-fill from solid areas that are definitely stable, like level bottom or large immovable chunks. Anything not reached might be floating.)
Alternatively, mark chunks that an explosion affected and just convert those cells.
7.4 Polygonize Pixels: For a given cluster of contiguous solid pixels to convert, generate a polygon shape. Use a marching squares or outline tracing algorithm to get the boundary of the cluster. Simplify the polygon if needed (Box2D prefers convex shapes or will need splitting into multiple fixtures). For now, even an approximate bounding box or circle around the cluster could work as a placeholder.
7.5 Create Body: Remove the pixels from the world (or mark them as part of a rigid body so they aren’t double-simulated). Create a Box2D body with the polygon shape at the corresponding position (pixel coordinates translated to world units, e.g. 1 pixel = 0.1 Box2D meters or similar scale). Make it dynamic so it falls.
7.6 Update Loop Integration: Each frame, after pixel simulation, step the Box2D world (with a fixed timestep, possibly multiple sub-steps for stability). Then sync any active bodies back to the pixel world:
For each physics body, update its pixel representation. E.g., clear its old pixels, then for each fixture (polygon) get the transformed vertices and mark those positions as that material. This is tricky for rotation – might have to re-draw the object’s pixels each frame. Alternatively, we can render the rigid bodies separately (e.g., draw a textured polygon) instead of converting to pixels each tick.
Noita likely didn’t convert moving rigid bodies back into pixel-by-pixel every frame (that would be expensive). They probably keep it as a separate object until it comes to rest, then reintegrate into the pixel grid​
80.LV
. We can do the same: while a chunk is a Box2D body, perhaps do not show it in the pixel grid; instead draw it via a polygon shape (with some visual similar to pixels). Once it comes to rest (Box2D body goes to sleep or very low velocity), we can remove the body and stamp those pixels back into the grid as static terrain.
7.7 Test Rigid Body: Manually trigger a conversion (for testing): e.g., remove a block of pixels under a "ceiling" chunk and call the conversion. See if the chunk falls under gravity and collides on ground. Check that it doesn’t pass through walls (tweak collision masks or simulation steps if needed).
7.8 Interaction: Allow the player to interact with bodies (e.g., kicking). This might involve creating a sensor or using Box2D’s collision callbacks, but can be done later. At least ensure bodies collide with each other and the world boundaries.
7.9 Edge Cases: Ensure very small clusters maybe just fall as individual pixels instead (could leave them in CA sim). And very large clusters – Box2D might struggle with extremely large or many polygons, consider splitting them or leaving some as static.
8. Player and Entity Integration
8.1 Player Entity: Create a player object that has a position, velocity, and maybe uses Box2D (a dynamic body for the player character). Or simpler: handle the player as an AABB that collides with terrain by checking the grid (like a tile-based platformer physics). Using Box2D for the player might simplify gravity and jumping, though pixel terrain collision means possibly treating certain pixels as colliders.
8.2 Movement Mechanics: Implement basic movement (left/right, jump). If using Box2D, apply forces or velocity changes on input. If custom, just move and then resolve collisions with solid pixels in the world grid (e.g., stop upward movement if head hits a solid pixel).
8.3 Camera: Make the camera follow the player. This means the rendering should center on the player’s position. Implement an offset so that we only render the chunk(s) around the player. Adjust the projection of the pixel texture accordingly (or update only the portion of the texture visible).
8.4 Entities (NPCs/Enemies): For now, perhaps spawn a simple moving entity or two for testing (or skip until later). These would likely also be physics bodies or simple logic that interacts with pixels (like an enemy could have its own AABB that is blocked by terrain).
8.5 Health/Death: Not critical for a sandbox engine, but implement a way for player to die (e.g., if submerged in lava or hit by falling object). This might be a later polish step.
9. Advanced Features and Optimizations
9.1 Fire and Explosions: Introduce fire propagation. Add a “fire” state to certain pixels or a separate fire layer. Implement that when flammable pixels are adjacent to fire, they catch fire after some time​
80.LV
. Burning a pixel might turn it into another type (wood -> coal or ash, etc.) or just empty after it burns out​
80.LV
.
9.2 Fluid Mixing & Reactions: Implement simple interactions like water + lava = stone (solidify), water + acid = dilution or some reaction, oil + water don’t mix (maybe oil floats on water due to density differences which we can simulate by ordering of updates or explicit check).
9.3 Graphics Improvements: Add lighting or shader effects if desired. For example, an OpenGL shader to make lava glow or to interpolate colors. Ensure these run efficiently on GPU.
9.4 GPU Simulation Experiment: (Optional) Try moving the most expensive part of simulation to a compute shader. For instance, write a GLSL compute shader that operates on a texture representing the world, outputting the next state. Benchmark it against CPU. This is advanced and optional if CPU is sufficient.
9.5 Save/Load: Implement serialization of the world state to a file, so games can be saved. This involves writing out the grid (which could be large – maybe compress it).
9.6 Performance Tweaks: Profile the game thoroughly. Identify hotspots: e.g., if updating water is slow, consider more efficient algorithms (maybe treat large bodies of water differently, like pressure simulation). If collision checking for player is slow, optimize data structures, etc. Tune chunk sizes if needed – larger chunks mean fewer boundary issues but bigger arrays per thread (which might hurt cache).
9.7 Memory Optimization: If memory is high due to large world, implement dynamic loading/unloading of chunks (e.g., only keep chunks around player in memory). Or compress inactive far-away chunks.
10. Testing and QA
10.1 Unit Tests: Write unit tests for critical functions like cellular automata update (given a small grid configuration, ensure the outcome matches expected rules), noise generation (consistency), etc. This can be done with a framework or simple asserts.
10.2 Integration Tests: Simulate scenarios: large explosion, burning down a structure, heavy fluid interactions. Check stability (no crashes, physics remains reasonable).
10.3 Cross-Platform Check: Although focusing on Linux, test on another OS (Windows, Mac) if possible to ensure portability of code (SDL and OpenGL are cross-platform, but threading and file paths might have minor differences).
10.4 Resource Usage: Monitor CPU and memory during long runs. Ensure no major memory leaks (use Valgrind or address sanitizers), and that CPU usage drops when game is idle (meaning our dirty region optimization works – when nothing is happening, threads should not be busy looping unnecessarily).
11. Documentation and Deployment
11.1 README Update: Update the README.md with any changes in build or run procedure (especially if new dependencies or configurations were added).
11.2 Code Comments: Ensure the code is well-commented, especially the tricky parts of the simulation and multi-threading.
11.3 Linux Packaging: Optionally, create a make install or package script for Linux (e.g., produce a .deb or AppImage for easy distribution).
11.4 Continuous Integration: Set up a CI pipeline (GitHub Actions or others) to automatically build and run basic tests on pushes, to ensure we don’t break the Linux build.
By following these steps in order, Claude (the coding assistant) should implement a functioning, optimized pixel physics engine. Each step builds on the last, and at all times, the game should be in a runnable state (even if not feature-complete) to allow iterative testing. This approach prioritizes core functionality and performance from the ground up, ensuring the final product is both high-performance and rich in simulation detail.
