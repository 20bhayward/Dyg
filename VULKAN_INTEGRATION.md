# Vulkan Integration - Current Status

We've fixed the core window handling issues and the Vulkan backend is now initializing correctly\! The application starts up and can run the rendering pipeline but fails during shader pipeline creation.

## Fixed Issues:

1. SDL window detection now properly identifies and uses the Vulkan-enabled window
2. Vulkan validation layers are now optional (continues if not available)
3. Surface creation now works correctly with the SDL_WINDOW_VULKAN flag
4. The Vulkan rendering backend initializes successfully

## Remaining Issues:

1. Shader pipeline creation is failing ("Failed to create graphics pipeline")
2. Segmentation fault after attempted rendering

The vulkan_minimal test we created demonstrates that the core window handling and Vulkan initialization is working, so the remaining issues are likely in the shader compilation and pipeline setup.

Next step is to debug the shader pipeline creation issue.
