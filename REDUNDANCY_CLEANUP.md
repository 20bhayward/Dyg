# Redundancy Cleanup Progress

## Completed Improvements

1. **Material Property Access Macro**
   - Added `#define MAT_PROPS(m) MATERIAL_PROPERTIES[static_cast<std::size_t>(m)]` to simplify material property access
   - This improves code readability and reduces typing across the codebase

2. **Added Helper Functions for Coordinate and Camera Management**
   - Added `ClampCamera()` for standardizing camera position clamping
   - Added `WorldToScreen()` for normalizing coordinate translation
  
3. **Added Chunk Boundary Helper Methods**
   - Added `HasLeftNeighbor()`, `HasRightNeighbor()`, and `HasBottomNeighbor()` to improve boundary checking
   - These methods simplify cross-chunk physics logic
  
4. **Debug Logging Standardization**
   - Added `DEBUG_LOG(x)` macro for conditional debug output
   - Will only print output when DEBUG_MODE is defined, reducing production code noise

5. **Physics Constants Namespace**
   - Added `Physics` namespace with fixed constants like `LIQUID_DISPERSAL` and `POWDER_INERTIA_MULTIPLIER`
   - Eliminates magic numbers for better maintainability

6. **Material Variation Helper**
   - Added `GetMaterialVariation()` method to encapsulate material color calculations
   - Reduces code duplication between `set()` and `updatePixelData()` methods

## Pending Work

1. **Set Method Refactoring**
   - Need to complete refactoring of `Chunk::set()` to use the new `GetMaterialVariation()` function
   - Currently failing because of partial implementation

2. **UpdatePixelData Refactoring**
   - Need to fully remove duplicated color variation calculations in `updatePixelData()`
   - Should reuse the `GetMaterialVariation()` function

3. **Replace MATERIAL_PROPERTIES Access**
   - Still need to replace remaining instances of direct `MATERIAL_PROPERTIES` access with the `MAT_PROPS` macro
   - This will improve code consistency and readability

4. **Testing**
   - Need to verify that refactored code produces identical visual results
   - No functionality should be changed, only code structure and organization

## Implementation Note

Encountered build errors when trying to update the existing codebase. The complexity of the refactoring requires careful attention to avoid breaking the switch/case statements and flow control structures. A phased approach is recommended:

1. First add all helper functions/macros (completed)
2. Then update `Chunk::set()` method in isolation
3. Then update `Chunk::updatePixelData()` method in isolation
4. Finally replace all remaining material property accesses

This approach will minimize the risk of build errors and make debugging easier.
