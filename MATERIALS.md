Material types
Materials all fall into the following categories:

Name	Properties
Solids	Materials that consist of solid pixels that do not move. They can be removed or be transformed into other types by spells.
Liquids	Substances that form flat pools and lakes inside suitable pits. They can be bottled in Flasks and often inflict various Status Effects. Each liquid has its own Density, causing it to layer above or below other liquids.
Magical Liquids	Similar to normal liquids, but all have some sort of transmutative or magical effect. Most of them commonly spawn inside Flasks on pedestals.
Gaseous	Non-collision pixels that obey gravity inversely, flowing upwards instead of down and forming "lakes" in pits in cave ceilings.
Powders	Materials that flow downwards and are subjected to gravity. They will naturally form piles on the ground.
Organic and Others	Anything else that doesn't quite fit into the other categories, such as background objects, meat, or fire.
Material properties
Density
Main article: Density
Density is a primarily a property of liquids in Noita, which causes heavier (more dense) liquids to sink, and lighter (less dense) liquids to rise. [Similar to a Layered drink.]

Durability
Durability determines resistance to damage. Projectiles like Luminous Drill, and all explosions such as those from Bomb, have a maximum durability that they can be used to destroy. If a material's durability exceeds this value, the projectile or explosion will not damage or destroy it.

The following table lists the maximum durability threshold of some spells, as well as some examples of materials with those durabilities.

Hardness

Explosion from Energy Orb (ray_energy=350,000) in coal (HP = 25,000) vs. rock (HP = 100,000)
Hardness also determines resistance to damage, secondarily to Durability.

Each pixel of material has an 'HP' value in the materials file. An explosion traces multiple rays around the point of explosion. These rays have a maximum "ray energy" that is used to consume the HP of each pixel of the material the ray is travelling through, up to the maximum radius of the explosion. When the "ray energy" is used up, the material is no longer destroyed.

This is why, for example, Unstable Crystal is worse at digging than TNT; TNT, in addition to being able to damage materials up to 11 durability (vs. 10 for Unstable Crystal), has more than 30 times the "ray energy" of Unstable Crystal, meaning that for materials with a lot of hardness like rock, explosions from Unstable Crystal will only destroy 2-3 pixels of material, whereas TNT is likely to remove material up to its full radius of 28 pixels.
