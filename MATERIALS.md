## Types

| Name                | Properties                                                                                                                                                         |

| **Solids**          | Materials that consist of solid pixels that do not move. They can be removed or transformed by spells.                                                               |
| **Liquids**         | Substances that form flat pools and lakes inside suitable pits. They can be bottled and often inflict various Status Effects. Each liquid has its own density, causing layering. |
| **Magical Liquids** | Similar to normal liquids, but with transmutative or magical effects. Most commonly spawn inside flasks on pedestals.                                                  |
| **Gaseous**         | Non-collision pixels that obey inverse gravity, flowing upwards and forming "lakes" in cave ceilings.                                                                 |
| **Powders**         | Materials that flow downwards, forming piles on the ground.                                                                                                        |
| **Organic and Others** | Anything else that doesn't quite fit into the above categories, such as background objects, meat, or fire.                                                          |
