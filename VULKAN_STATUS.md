# Vulkan Integration Status

## Current Status

The project has been successfully refactored to support both OpenGL and Vulkan rendering backends. The Vulkan backend can now initialize correctly and begin rendering frames, but still has some issues with shader pipeline creation.

## Fixed Issues

1. ✅ Removed or properly wrapped OpenGL-specific shader code with `#ifndef USE_VULKAN` / `#endif` blocks
2. ✅ Fixed namespace issues with functions
3. ✅ Added proper shader compilation helpers for OpenGL backend
4. ✅ Fixed dependency issues in the codebase
5. ✅ Made the renderer compile with Vulkan support enabled (-DUSE_VULKAN=ON)
6. ✅ Implemented CreateRenderBackend function referenced in Renderer.cpp
7. ✅ Fixed initialization and cleanup issues to prevent crashes during shutdown
8. ✅ Added null checks for Vulkan objects to prevent invalid memory access
9. ✅ Fixed getRendererInfo() to handle uninitialized objects
10. ✅ Fixed SDL window handling with proper SDL_WINDOW_VULKAN flag
11. ✅ Made validation layer usage optional to work on systems without validation support
12. ✅ Implemented proper window detection for Vulkan surface creation

## Current Issues

1. The main application can initialize Vulkan but fails during rendering:
   - ❌ Shader pipeline creation is failing for some shaders
   - ❌ Resource cleanup has validation errors
   - ❌ Multi-pass rendering integration incomplete

## Next Steps

1. Fix shader pipeline creation issues:
   - Debug shader compilation errors
   - Fix vertex attribute descriptions
   - Implement proper descriptor sets

2. Fix resource cleanup:
   - Ensure proper destruction order of Vulkan resources
   - Add more robust error handling during cleanup

3. Complete the remaining VulkanBackend implementation:
   - Multi-pass rendering (shadows, bloom)
   - Proper swapchain recreation on window resize
   - Performance optimizations

## Testing Status

1. ✅ Created a simplified Vulkan test application (vulkan_simple_test is working)
2. ✅ Created a minimal Vulkan test that validates our window detection and rendering fixes
3. ❌ Main app with basic Vulkan rendering (pipeline creation issues)
4. ❌ Texture loading and rendering
5. ❌ Shader uniform updates
6. ❌ Multi-pass rendering (main, shadow, bloom)
7. ❌ Performance comparison with OpenGL backend
